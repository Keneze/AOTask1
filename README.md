QA Automation Task 

The task that will need to be completed can be found below.    

Complete and submit a Selenium test that meets the following criteria:  

·       Goes to https://ao.com/  

·       Searches for “Washing machines” 

·       Selects a Brand (Beko / Hotpoint etc.) to be navigated to a lister page 

·       Uses the filter navigation on the left to filter products by a feature of your choice. For example: 

o   an “Energy Rating” of “A++ & above” or 

o   a “Wash Load” of “Large” or 

o   a “Colour” of “Silver” etc. 

·       Verify the results are successfully filtered based on your selection criteria. 

 

Points to keep in mind: 

·       Write and factor the test as you would if it were part of a larger regression test automation pack, using C#. 

·       The test should be easily maintainable/extendable 

·       The test should be as loosely coupled to Selenium as possible, so that if we wanted to swap in a different test automation tool, we would not need to throw the test away 

 

Submit the entire solution as a zip file so it can be run to see the results.
